- **Using VS2017**
     ``` 
       > git clone https://github.com/dmytrosemonkin1111/Cake-Shop-Multi-Page-App_ASP.NET-Core.git
       > cd Cake-Shop/
    ```
    - Now Open the `CakeShop.sln` through `VS2017`.
    - Open `appsettings.json` & change the connection string. (But wait! you may not need to change it as this the default connection string of `SQL Server Express` that comes with `Visual Studio`).

    - Open `Package Manager Console` from `Tools` and enter `update-database`.
    - Hit `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging.
